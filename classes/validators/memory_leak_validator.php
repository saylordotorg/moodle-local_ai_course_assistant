/**
 * Flags AI responses that leak carryover-memory state across learners or
 * fabricate memories of prior chat sessions.
 *
 * Two threat surfaces:
 *
 *   1. **Cross-learner state leak.** The carryover-memory feature (v5.3.0)
 *      keeps short notes about a learner's sticking points in a private
 *      table. The model must NEVER reveal another learner's state — but
 *      a jailbreak prompt can ask "what are other learners struggling
 *      with?" and a poorly-aligned model might confabulate names or
 *      aggregate claims. This validator pattern-matches outputs that
 *      reference "other learners", "your classmates", "the cohort",
 *      etc., or claim aggregate statistics about course peers.
 *
 *   2. **False memory narration.** The classifier processes one turn at
 *      a time; the model has no access to prior chat sessions. A response
 *      that says "I remember from our last session..." or "you mentioned
 *      this earlier" is fabricating continuity that did not exist. This
 *      breaks learner trust and surfaces in screenshots.
 *
 * Three corpus fixtures dropped in v5.3.24 (when the validator did not
 * yet exist) are re-added under tests/security/memory_leak/.
